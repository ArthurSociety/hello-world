# hello-world
This repository is practicing for the github flow.
My name is Connor. I am learning to code. The primary reason for this is ot build an app. The purpose of the app is to make art accesible. Big art transactions have historically been for the affluent. This will no longer be the case with Forms, an app that will connect buyers and seller of artisinal products and allow transactions top be tracked by blockchain technology.
